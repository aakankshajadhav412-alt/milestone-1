**Introduction**

Background of text processing.

Importance of summarization and paraphrasing in research/education.

Motivation for using models like T5, BART, PEGASUS.

Problem statement (e.g., “Large texts are difficult to process, so summarization and paraphrasing are needed”).
**Objectives**

To generate concise summaries from long text.

To produce multiple paraphrases of the same sentence.

To compare different NLP models for performance.

To evaluate semantic similarity between original and generated texts.


**Methodology**
**Step 1: Installing & Importing Libraries**

Transformers library → provides pre-trained NLP models like T5, BART, PEGASUS.

SentencePiece → tokenizer tool used with T5 and PEGASUS.

These libraries allow you to load models and generate summaries or paraphrases without training from scratch.

** Step 2: Loading Pre-Trained Models**

T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

Converts every NLP problem into a text-to-text format.

Example: "summarize: long text" → produces a shorter version.

BART

A denoising autoencoder transformer.

Very good at abstractive summarization.

PEGASUS

Specially trained for summarization tasks.

Generates human-like summaries because it was pre-trained on "gap sentence prediction".

** Step 3: Summarization**

You give a long passage of text to the model.

The model generates a short, meaningful version of that passage.

Parameters used:

min_len & max_len → control how short/long the summary is.

beam search (num_beams) → ensures better quality by checking multiple possible summaries.

no_repeat_ngram_size → avoids repeated phrases.

 Example:
Original text: "A transformer is an electrical device that transfers energy between circuits."
Summary: "A transformer transfers energy between circuits."
**
 Step 4: Paraphrasing**

Models like PEGASUS, T5 (paraphrase model), BART (paraphrase version) are used.

Instead of shortening, they rewrite text in a different way but with the same meaning.

Example:

Original: "A transformer transfers electrical energy between circuits."

Paraphrase 1: "Electrical energy is passed between circuits by a transformer."

Paraphrase 2: "A transformer moves electrical energy from one circuit to another."

**Step 5: Similarity Checking**

Uses SentenceTransformer (MiniLM) → creates vector embeddings of sentences.

Cosine similarity → measures how close two sentences are in meaning.

Helps evaluate:

How close a summary is to the original text.

How similar paraphrases are to each other.

Step 6: Visualization

Summary Lengths (number of words generated).

Similarity Scores (how well the summary matches the original).

Paraphrase Lengths & Similarity (comparison among different models).

Helps in comparing T5 vs BART vs PEGASUS.

**Step 7: Bigram Analysis**

Bigrams = pairs of consecutive words.

Example: in "a transformer transfers electrical energy", the bigrams are:

"a transformer", "transformer transfers", "transfers electrical", "electrical energy".

Useful for analyzing frequent technical phrases in text.
**
Conclusion**

Summarization shortens text while keeping the main meaning.

Paraphrasing rewrites text in multiple ways with the same sense.

PEGASUS gives the most accurate and concise summaries.

T5 and BART perform strongly for paraphrasing tasks.

Similarity analysis ensures outputs stay semantically close to the original.

Bigram and visualization methods help in analyzing text structure and performance.

The combined pipeline provides an efficient way for text simplification, rephrasing, and analysis.
